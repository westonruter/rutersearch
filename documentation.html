		<p>Awhile ago, before I was a Perl programmer, I wanted to start a search engine. I searched and 
		searched, but I couldn't find one that I could afford and one that I liked. So I settled for a lesser 
		search engine (for $50) that I thought would serve my needs. Since I was not a programmer, I had 
		no idea what features a search engine should have, and I paid the price for my naivety. That 
		search engine was pathetic, a total disappointment, and a rip off. My mistake.</p>

		<p>So when I became a Perl programmer, I started RuterSearch. I wanted it to be better than any 
		other, and cheaper. So I incorporated everything that I would have wanted, and what I anticipate 
		you need. I have spent more time on this project than any other, and I hope it shows!</p>

		<a name="features"><h2>Features</h2></a>
		<ol>
			<li>
			<big>Installation program:</big>&nbsp; Sometimes large scripts are hard to install, especially for a novice. 
				So I devised an installation program to automatically setup files for use on your server. All you have 
				to do is upload all files and folders in the RuterSearch archive. Additionally, if you are using a UNIX type
				system you will need to edit the path to perl on the first lone of "admin.cgi" and <tt>chmod 755 admin.cgi</tt>. 
				Detailed instructions on how to install RuterSearch can be <a href="#installation">found here</a>.
			</li>

			<li>
			<big>Administration:</big> Many search engines require you to edit code in order for everything to be 
				configured just how you want. Since most people are not programmers, this can be an unfriendly task.
				Therefore I created an Administration program to handle most of the configuration for you.
			</li>

			<li>
			<big>Search syntax:&nbsp;</big> RuterSearch has more syntax features than even Yahoo! Here is the syntax for 
				searching RuterSearch:
			<ul>
				<li>
				<b>Phrases</b>: To search for a certain sequence of words (a phrase), set it off with double quotation marks. 
					To RuterSearch, phrases work much like regular search words.
					<i>Example: "Spanish food"</i>
				</li>
				<li>
				<b>Required words</b>: To require that a word to be in a entry, put a plus sign before the word. 
					<i>Examples: +Mozilla, +"perl scripts"</i>
				</li>
				<li>
				<b>Rejected words</b>: To reject an entry that has a certain word, put a minus sign before the word. 
					<i>Examples: -Microsoft -"Bill Gates"</i>
				</li>
				<li>
				<b>Section restrictions</b>: Website entries in RuterSearch are divided into sections, which are:
					title, description, url, keywords, and author (also date and type). As default, a search is performed on every section of an entry. 
					To restrict searching of a word to a specific section of an entry, enter the name of the section 
					or the first letter of the section, followed by a pair of parentheses, and within the parentheses, 
					enter the search query. You can use different section restrictors together. <i>Examples: title(Mozilla) and t(Mozilla); u(netscape.com) and url(netscape.com);
					etc...&nbsp; searchable sections are: title, description, url, keywords, and author</i>.
				</li>
				<li>
				<b>Wildcards</b>: There are two wildcards, "?" and "*", same as Windows and Unix/Linux. A question 
					mark "?" matches a single character. An asterisk "*" matches multiple characters. 
					<i>Examples: (e.g. Ruter*, ?uter, *script, ?ozill*, etc.)</i>
				</li>
				<li>
				<b><i>Summary:</i></b> All syntax features can be used together to create complex searches. Here 
					is the order in which you can combine syntax: </li>
					<ol>
						<li>section restrictions</li>
						<li>required and rejected words</li>
						<li>words and phrases. <i>Examples Below<b></b></i></li>
					</ol>

					<blockquote>
					<ul>
						<li>+elections -local keywords(+politic*)</li>
						<li>title(+browser -"Internet Explorer" -IE) Netscape Mozilla</li>
						<li>+perl -C++ title(RuterSoft) author("Weston Ruter")</li>
					</ul>
					</blockquote>
					<li>
						<a name="substitutions"><big>Substitutions:</big></a> One feature that everyone needs is 
							customization. Every page needs to look exactly how you want and substitutions allow you to 
							do that easily and effectively. This is how substitutions work: Lets say you want to 
							customize the search results page, you would open <i>html/searchresults.html</i> in your favorite 
							html editor and design it however you want by incorporating substitutions such as <tt>_totalentries_</tt>
							and <tt>_totalresults_</tt> (see below for more) where you want them to be displayed. When a search is
							performed, the search engine would open <i>searchresults.html</i> and substitute the substitution with
							the real value. There are five pages that are customizable in this way, and they are <i>search.html, 
							searchresults.html, resulttemplate.html, add.html, and additionresults.html</i>. <i>search.html</i>
							is the search home page which is displayed when no search has been made. <i>searchresults.html and 
							resulttemplate.html</i> are used together. <i>searchresults.html</i> is the page where the results 
							are displayed, and the code in <i>resulttemplate.html</i> determines what each result looks like. <b>More information about 
							customizing the look of RuterSearch can be <a href="#configuration">found here</a></b>.
							All substitutions are case insensitive. <i>Examples: <tt>_totalentries_</tt> replaced with 150; <tt>_totalresults_</tt> replaced with 12; etc...</i> Here is a list of all Substitutions:
					</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<big>Styling of matched words:</big> Another option I built in is the styling of matched words. 
					If turned on (either by user or by administration), a word that was matched will be highlighted in 
					the way you specify. To change the style of matched words, look at the class <i><b>.matchedWord</b></i> in 
					the &lt;style&gt; tag of <i>searchresults.html</i>. <a href="#configuration">More info</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<big>Databases:</big> RuterSearch comes in two versions, one with MySQL support and one without. But both support a Text Delimited Database File which was the only available database type in earlier versions. Entries can be added and deleted from Administration.
					</li>
					<li>
						<big>Query record:</big> From Administration, a record of search queries and other information about the user can be viewed by clicking on the link labeled "Search History". 
					</li>
					<li>
						<big>Addition page:</big> This is designed to simplify the addition of the new entries. From Administration, you can password protect access to the addition page with the Administration password.
					</li>
					<li>
						<big>Website spider:</big> The website spider simply parses out all links in an HTML file. It then visits each of those URL's and gets information such as the title, description, keywords, and author. And finally it adds each qualified entry to the database.  From Administration, you can password protect access to the spider with the Administration password.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>

		<a name="installation"><h2>Installation</h2></a>
		<p>As of RuterSearch Perl version 3.5 and RuterSearch Php version 1.5, the installation program has been 
			integrated into the administration program <i>admin.cgi</i>. Here are instructions for installing RuterSearch:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Extract the files from the downloaded archive to a temporary folder.</li>
			<li>Upload all files and folders to the desired location on your server, most likely the <i>CGI-BIN</i> for Perl scripts. Usually this is done with an FTP client such as <a href="http://www.ipswitch.com/cgi/download_eval.pl?product=WL-1000">WS_FTP</a>.</li>
			<li>For UNIX type systems, you will need to modify the first line of <i>admin.cgi</i> to reflect your path to perl. Most likely the first line will need to look like one of the following: <br />
				<tt>#!/usr/bin/perl -w</tt>
					<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>or</b><br />
				<tt>#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w</tt><br />
				If these paths do not work, you can type in <tt>which perl</tt> into a Telnet prompt or just ask your system administrator.</li>
			<li>
			<li><a name="setpermissions">Additionally for UNIX type systems: set <i>install.cgi</i>'s permissions</a> to execute (Linux/Unix command <i>CHMOD 755</i>).
				Usually your FTP client will have CHMOD ability built in and you should be able to find it. You need to set
				<i>admin.cgi</i>'s permissions to CHMOD 755 which means all execute, owner write, and read.<br />
				If your FTP Client doesn't have CHMOD built in, you can simply type the command directly into a Telnet prompt. An example of this is:

				<table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="3" border="1">
				<tr><td><tt>
				Login: <b>johnsmith</b><br />
				Password: (password hidden)<br />
				<br />
				[johnsmith@245.27.1.120 johnsmith]$ <b>cd http-home/rutersearch</b><br />
				[johnsmith@245.27.1.120 rutersearch]$ <b>chmod 755 admin.cgi</b>
				</tt></td></tr>
				</table>
			</li>
			<li>
				Now run <i>admin.cgi</i> from your browser and it will setup all files that will be used by RuterSearch.
			</li>
		</ol>





		<a name="configuration"><h2>Configuration and Customization</h2></a>
		<ol>
			<li>
				After you install RuterSearch, you can configure it however how you like. 
				And the best way to do this is through the RuterSearch administration program. Login to 
				<i>admin.cgi</i> with your password (the default password is <i>password</i>).
			</li>
			<li>
				Basically everything that you might need to do to configure RuterSearch, you can do from within 
				Administration. But <b>customizing</b> the page look is a bit different. Below I will explain:
			</li>
			<li><h3>Customization</h3>
				<p>The way RuterSearch displays pages is it that when it is run, it takes in specific HTML pages that you have created, and then it substitutes
					data onto specific locations on that page that you specify. This is done through the use of 
					substitutions. By opening <i>search.html</i> (or any page listed below) in a text editor, you can design the search home page 
					to look exactly how you want. Simply write HTML as you would normally 
					for your website. When you want to display the total entries in the database, you would insert 
					<tt>_totalentries_</tt> into the HTML page where you want that text displayed. For more information 
					about substitutions and a list of all substitutions for each HTML page, 
					<a href="#substitutions">click here</a>.</p>

				<p>Below is a list of each editable page with descriptions.</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><b><i>search.html</i></b> - If someone accesses <i>search.cgi</i>, the search program, without searching for anything, this page is displayed. It is essentially a home page for the search engine.</li>
					<li><b><i>searchresults.html</i></b> - This is the page that displays the results of a search. Design it how you want it to look then insert <tt>_searchresults_</tt> where you want to display the results of the user's search. Each returned result can be customized as well, which is done through editing the following file:</li>
					<li><b><i>resulttemplate.html</i></b> - When a search is performed, this file is used as a template for the search engine to display each result. All results are appended to the substitution <tt>_searchresults_</tt>, which is then displayed in the previous file, <i>searchresults.html</i>.</li>
					<li><b><i>add.html</i></b> - If you have decided to not restrict access to the addition page, this page will be useful if you want to enable users to add websites to the database.</li>
					<li><b><i>additionresults.html</i></b> - This page shows the results of an addition to the database.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>To illustrate how to use substitutions, look at the following example which will display a message like "There are 125 entries in the database."</p>
				<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="2"><tr><td>
					<tt>
						&lt;html&gt;<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;head&gt;<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;My Search Engine&lt;/title&gt;<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;body {<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-family: Arial, Helvetica;<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/style&gt;<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/head&gt;<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;body&gt;<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to my search engine. There are _totalentries_ entries in the database.<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/body&gt;<br />
						&lt;/html&gt;
					</tt>
				</td></tr></table>

				<p>The search results page is a bit more involved. In the &lt;head&gt; of <i>searchresults.html</i>, there is a &lt;style&gt; tag which contains information on how to display certain elements.
				The most important style is the <b>.matchedWord</b> class which tells the user's browser how to highlight a matched word (if that option is enabled). The following code in the &lt;style&gt; tag would highlight matched words in yellow.</p>
			
				<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="2"><tr><td>
					<tt>
						&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.matchedWord {<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: yellow;<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
						&lt;/style&gt;
					</tt>
				</td></tr></table>

				<p>The user needs to be able to navigate back and forth through the results that have been found. This navigation can be appended to the <tt>_searchresults_</tt> substitution, or you can create your own navigation by using JavaScript and substitiutions together. The <i>searchresults.html</i> that comes with RuterSearch uses the JavaScript created navigation. </p>
				
			<p>Knowledge of HTML, preferably CSS, and possibly JavaScript, is required. But do not worry! These are very simple languages to learn. Pick up a book, or visit the <a href="http://w3.org/">W3C</a> for official specifications.</p>
			</li>

		</ol>		


		<a name="running"><h2>Running RuterSearch</h2></a>
		<ul>
			<li>
				To run a part of RuterSearch, do not open the HTML files for they are only templates.
				Rather you need to run the CGI files, which are the program files. Following are all
				the files that can be executed:
			</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>search.cgi</b> - Without any query, this will display the main search page (<i>search.html</i>). 
					When a search query is made, <i>searchresults.html</i> is displayed with results displayed in the form of
					<i>resulttemplate.html</i>.					
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>add.cgi</b> - Run this program to add entries to the database. Without any query, <i>add.html</i> is displayed.
					When an addition is made, <i>additionresults.html</i> is displayed.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>add.cgi</b> - This is another way to add entries to the database. By suppling a URL, the spider will 
					visit that page and add each link to the database. The spider design cannot cannot be customized as <i>add.cgi</i> and <i>search.cgi</i> can.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>admin.cgi</b> - This allows you to make changes to RuterSearch.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>config.cgi</b> - This is not a program, but rather it is the configuration file. It ends in the extension "cgi" to prevent it from being viewed by people on the web.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
