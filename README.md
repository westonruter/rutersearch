RuterSearch was a project I started in 1999 after being disappointed with a
search Perl script I purchased. I bought Perl for Dummies and began to learn
Perl myself to implement my own search script. It was a great learning
experience, and a pretty nice lightweight search script was the result; I sold
it on Qwerks for awhile at $25 per license. Eventually, I discontinued
development on RuterSearch; however, the original source code and documentation
are still available here for historical purposes. I have released the code under
the GPL license (if stated differently anywhere else, please disregard), but I
would really hope that no one would use this now!
